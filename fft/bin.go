// WinSize gives the smallest positive window size (n, c) (n samples covering c

// that a cycle appears after n samples.  The cycle is approximate for period functions of frequency
// fA but exact for some frequency within an error range around that (at worst within [fA .. fA + fE]).
//
// Special case:
//  if it overflows, it returns -1, -1
//
// For example, to find a good window size for detecting a=440 Hz in an s=17.6Khz sample,
// we'd call WinSize(440Hz, 17.6KHz, 0.001Hz), giving n, and c.  The window size n
// in any signal of sampling rate s has c full cycles of any signal at frequency a, with
// very little error because (sc % a) is small.  As a result, using a DFT over
// n samples will often have less error and noise in it, since the DFT assumes a cyclic
// signal (actually stationary,  cyclic applied infinitely satisfies).
